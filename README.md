ShopifyAPI-Java
===============

ShopifyAPI Java SDK - Re-Caffeinated!

Since Shopify decided to stop the support of their Shopify4J API bindings project, I have decided to implement something
to fill the potential void....

Why? Because I am leaving in Ottawa and Shopify is based in Ottawa :+)

It is still work in progress, I'll update this readme, when the sdk will be really ready for the general public..
